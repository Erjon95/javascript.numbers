# Printing Shapes

* **Objective** - To create a shape-printer using `console.log`.
* **Purpose** - To establish familiarity with basic Javascript.
* **Description**
    * You are provided with a file located at `./assets/js/utils.js`
    * Edit the file by defining each of the respective function-stubs.
    * The objective is to create a program which will print shapes with dimensions dependent on user-input.



## Part 1 - Clone the project

* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).


## Part 2 - Modifying `numbers.js`
* Upon cloning the project, from a browser, open the `./index.html` located at the root of the project.
* From the browser, open the **insepctor-tools**.
* The inspector tools should reveal `log` messages from `console` displaying an `expectedOutput` and an `actualOutput`.
* Modify `./assets/js/numbers.js` to ensure that the `expectedOutput` and `actualOutput` are the same.
